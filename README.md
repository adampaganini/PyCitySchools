This analysis explores and compares performace metrics of high schools. This analysis used average reading and math scores to calculate the overall passing percentages per school as the response variable that was measured. The input variables or factors that could have lead to certain outcomes were School Type, Total School Budget,	Per Student Budget,	and School Size.

Contrary to conventional thinking, there does not appear to be a positive correlation between per student spending and average passing rates, even regardless of school type (charter v public).

More than school type or spending it appears that large school size has a larger negative effect on average math, reading, and overall passing rates (as shown in the "size_summary" data frame).

Instead of cutting budgets of public schools that have poor assing rates, this analysis highlights that schools should focus their resources on hosting smaller class sizes to increasse their passing rates- not punishing large public schools with less funding.
